# Plan for 02-04-22

1. Compare you hardware map files and do a code review. Try and get all your files to a point you that you would be happy uploading them.
2. Once you have those files looked over you all can start on the real hardware map files.
3. Make a standardized version of the robots config on the robot controller. This is so that when we switch between each kits code we can use the same hwmap.
4. If you get passed this point try and make a op mode


## Work flow notes

- Everything will now be in this git hub [repo](https://github.com/O-Despo/Lab-School-Robo-21-22) under the `ftc-code` files
- The `kit-1` and `kit-2` folders should be treated like the team code folders. This is where you place the respective teams files
- `samples` is filled with the samples from the ftc repo

## General notes

- You should make a instance of your hardware map code in the op mode meaning you need to not declare hardware in the opmode itself.
- If you have time and can figure out how to upload to the robot, test if port 2 is working on the controller.
